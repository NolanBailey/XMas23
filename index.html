			<h2>littleBits w9 proto</h2>
			<p>If there is a Bit that doesn't exist, you now have the power to make it. This one's for engineers and inventors who know their way around a soldering iron!</p>

			<h2>littleBits i7 remote trigger</h2>
			<p>The remote trigger lets you use a common remote control with your Bit. Make your littleBits circuit and point a remote control at the remote trigger's sensor. Then, press any button on your remote control to activate the Bit. The remote trigger will work with almost any button on a remote that uses infrared light to send signals.</p>

			<h2>littleBits i31 oscillator</h2>
			<p>The oscillator is a sound source that is capable of creating audio tones that will be used in almost every sound experiment you create with littleBits. This is the main sound source for the Synth Kit and Music Inventor Kit!</p>

			<h2>littleBits i36 micro sequencer</h2>
			<p>The micro sequencer sends out voltages based on the position of each of the 4 "step" knobs. Connect it to an oscillator and it will step through the "sequence" consecutively to make a melody (the LEDs tell you which step is active).</p>

			<h2>littleBits w29 perf</h2>
			<p>The perf Bit is a quick and easy way to prototype a circuit for a brand-new Bit. It's a standard 0.1" perfboard with a VCC and ground bus connected to our bitSnap connectors.</p>

			<h2>littleBits w30 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</h2>
			<p>The littleBits Bluetooth Low Energy Bit (marked "BLE" on your Bit) allows you to control your inventions wirelessly. All you need is the Gizmos and Gadgets 2nd Edition app and this Bit to move motors on wireless vehicles, or trigger buzzers for pranks. You can also use your circuit to control functions on your device, like triggering the camera to take a picture.</p>
